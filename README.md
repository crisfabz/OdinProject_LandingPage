# OdinProject_LandingPage

\*For this project, I'll be creating an entire web page from a design provided by theOdinProject.

\*This project has 5 sections: Navigation bar, header, page information, call to action and footer.

\*This is the summarization of all the things that I've learned from the previous lessons.
